Database Management System(DBMS)
Types Of Data:-
Structured 
Unstructured
Semi-Structured


TYpes of Data base:-
DBMS
-realational:- ROWS AND COLUMNS
-object oriented:- OBJECT 
-Hierarchial
-cloud
-network
-NOoSQL 


SQL:-RDBMS=Data is stored in table format
NOSQL:-Not only SQL

NoSQL:-
(Not only SOL)
4 categories
-Key value based(Dynamo DB)
-column oriented(cassandra)
-Document based(Mongo DB)
-Graph Based:-social media


Document based database

collection
document->{key-value}
Collections in mongo DB 
JSON data size 16MB
simple 
capped-limit sized collection:-It stores updated + limited data 


Why NoSQL?

NoSQL databases are used in nearly every industry.Use cases range from the highly critical (e.g., storing financial data and healthcare records) to the more fun and frivolous (e.g., storing IoT readings from a smart kitty litter box).

When should NoSQL be used?
When deciding which database to use, decision-makers typically find one or more of the following factors lead them to selecting a NoSQL database:


Fast-paced Agile development
Storage of structured and semi-structured data
Huge volumes of data
Requirements for scale-out architecture
Modern application paradigms like microservices and real-time streaming



NoSQL databases typically have flexible schemas. Note that some NoSQL databases like MongoDB also have support for schema validation, so developers can lock down their schemas as much or as little as they'd like when they are ready.


Mongo DB
-It is document based NoSQL database
-High volume data storage
-use collections and documents




Advantages:-

Full cloud-based developer data platform
Flexible document schemas
Widely supported and code-native data access
Change-friendly design
Powerful querying and analytics
Easy horizontal scale-out with sharding
High performance (speed)
Simple installation
Cost-effective






Drawbacks:-

a. Joins not Supported
MongoDB doesnâ€™t support joins like a relational database. Yet one can use joins functionality by adding by coding it manually. But it may slow execution and affect performance.

b. High Memory Usage
MongoDB stores key names for each value pairs. Also, due to no functionality of joins, there is data redundancy. This results in increasing unnecessary usage of memory.

c. Limited Data Size
JSON 16MB

d. Limited Nesting




Nested Documents:-
{
'name':'Anjali',
id:2001,
address:{
	first-line:'Gurugram',
	second:line:'Northcap university',
	}
}






Basic data types in mongoDB:-
1.string-key can have quotes or not.
2.int;- stores integer values
3.double:- stores floating values
4.boolean:-true, false
5.null;-
6.Array
7.object
8.objectId
9.undefined
10. binary data
11.date:-var date=new Date()
12.min and max key
13. symbol
14. javascript
15. timestamp

key must not be duplicate
Operation
CRUD
Create-read-update-delete
